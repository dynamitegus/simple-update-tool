# Simple Update tool
This is the successor to my [update script](https://github.com/dynamitegus/systemupdate) this script was eventually updated further but its apparently not in the repo... huh.

anyway, this program is two things, a challange and project for me to write in rust and so i dont have to think about the different os's i am using, so i can just write ```up -s``` or ```up -r``` to update.
